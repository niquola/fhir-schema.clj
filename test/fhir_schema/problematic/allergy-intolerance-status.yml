concept:
- code: active
  display: Active
  definition: An active record of a risk of a reaction to the identified substance.
  concept:
  - {code: active-confirmed, display: Active Confirmed, definition: 'A high level
      of certainty about the propensity for a reaction to the identified substance,
      which may include clinical evidence by testing or rechallenge.'}
- code: inactive
  display: Inactive
  definition: An inactivated record of a risk of a reaction to the identified substance
  concept:
  - {code: resolved, display: Resolved, definition: A reaction to the identified substance has been clinically reassessed by testing or rechallenge re-exposure and considered to be resolved e.g. change the word rechallenged to re-exposure}
  - {code: refuted, display: Refuted, definition: 'A propensity for a reaction to
      the identified substance has been disproven with a high level of clinical certainty,
      which may include testing or rechallenge, and is refuted.'}
